# ValAgents.py | Valorant Agents Module

A Python module that essentially serves as a wrapper for the Valorant API Agents endpoint.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

No support for PyPi yet, and thus you cannot install this module with `pip install`. Maybe I will do this in the future.
For now, just download from Releases and place `ValAgents.py` in your project directory.

## üîß Usage & Examples

1) Import the module
```py
from ValAgents import ValAgents
```
2) Initialize
```py
agents = ValAgents()
```



Further documentation is in the works following the rewrite, but I am busy with work so give me a few.
