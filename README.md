# ValAgents.py | Valorant Agents Module

A Python module that can return a list of VALORANT agents and/or their respective UUIDs by role.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

No support for PyPi yet, and thus you cannot install this module with `pip install`. Maybe I will do this in the future.
For now, just download from [here](https://github.com/Mister-SOSA/ValAgents.py/releases/tag/v1.0) and place `ValAgents.py` in your project directory.

## üîß Usage

```py
import ValAgents as agents

sentinels = agents.sentinels()

print(sentinels)
```

will print a dictionary with each sentinel's name as the key, and their UUID as the value:
`{'Killjoy': '1e58de9c-4950-5125-93e9-a0aee9f98746', 'Cypher': '117ed9e3-49f3-6512-3ccf-0cada7e3823b', 'Sage': '569fdd95-4d10-43ab-ca70-79becc718b46'}`


```py
import ValAgents as agents

jett_uuid = agents.deulists().get('Jett')

print(jett_uuid)
```
will print Jett's UUID as a string:
`add6443a-41bd-e414-f6ad-e58d267f4e9`


```py
import ValAgents as agents

all_agents = list(agents.list_all_agents.keys()) # get only agent names from dict

all_agents.sort() # sort the agents alphabetically

print(all_agents)
```
Will print a list with all the agents in alphabetical order:
`['Astra', 'Breach', 'Brimstone', 'Cypher', 'Jett', 'KAY/O', 'Killjoy', 'Omen', 'Phoenix', 'Raze', 'Reyna', 'Sage', 'Skye', 'Sova', 'Viper', 'Yoru']`
